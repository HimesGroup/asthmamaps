County-level characterisitcs of adults with asthma in the U.S. according to [Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System (BRFSS)](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/) data.

Authors: Rebecca Greenblatt, Blanca Himes.

Repository of Shiny app code for [asthmamaps](http://asthmamaps.org/), which shows the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of adults with and without asthma according to BRFSS data from years 2007-2012. Counties can be clicked to see the corresponding asthma prevalence and the number of respondents available. County names can be selected in the panel to view the characteristics of the respondents with and without asthma. Survey respondents were defined as having asthma if they answered “yes” to the question “Have you ever been told by a doctor, nurse, or other health professional that you had asthma?” and to the question “Do you still have asthma?” Survey respondents were defined to not have asthma if the answer to these questions was “no.” 

Note: the data files are not present in the repository, and the code will not work without them.
